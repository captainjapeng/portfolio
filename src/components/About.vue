          Hello!
          I started learning how to code when I was 10 years old because of the hit game
          Dota on Warcraft 3 which got inspired me to create my own video game.
          Following online tutorials, I began studying OpenGL and C++, and when the first
          triangle appeared on the screen, I became fascinated.

          Today, having had the opportunity to work for several startups and meeting
          mentors who have taught me a lot about entrepreneurship.
          I'm currently working at
